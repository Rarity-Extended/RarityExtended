# Rarity Extended

An On-Chain Adventure.  
Our goal is to make the user experience very straightforward and easy while giving a nostalgic old feeling from the good old days of RPGs.

## Roadmap

- [X] **The Forest V2**, send your adventurer in a multiday adventure in the Forest
- [ ] **The Bank**, deposit and earn tokens and yield thanks to ape.tax
- [ ] **Tooltip and Info**, a nice UI (the best) is nice, but to be able to get info about the game, is better
- [ ] **Crafting**, use your loot to craft weapon and armor
- [ ] **The Boars**, coop/versus quest where you have to maintain, or kill, all the boar ecosystem
- [ ] **Items from the officials codex**, check all your items directly in RE
- [ ] **RarityName & RNS**, build you charactersheet for you year long adventure
- [ ] **Customizable Adventurers**, be unique
- [ ] **UI/UX reflow**, let's build something smooth and better
- [ ] **Multi-step adventure**, what if you could start an adventurer with multiple path, for days ?

## Project setup

If you want to run the UI yourself, check the following steps:
```bash
yarn
yarn run dev
```
